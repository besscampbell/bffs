# ℹ️ Description

What a feeling when you meet someone that you have a connection with. What do you do with that connection if it's not a romantic one? The hesistation to open up and time constraints impede deep connections from developing. What if there was a space where people could commit to developing a relationship and do so on their own schedule? Becoming BFFs will create a platform for two people to form a deeper connection by being prompted to share stories, facts, and answers to the deep questions about their lives.

# ✅ Objectives

Create a space for two people to share intimacy on the internet.
